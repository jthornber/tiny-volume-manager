Test suite for device-mapper thin provisioning targets.  Uses Ruby
1.8.x.

To run:

Edit config.rb, adding suitable entries for you test machine.
Check things are ok with a dry run:

     ruby ./run_tests.rb

Once you're happy you can set the env var THIN_TESTS and run it for
real:

     export THIN_TESTS=EXECUTE
     ruby ./run_tests.rb
   
You can select subsets of the tests, for more info:

    ruby ./run_tests.rb --help

Alternatively you can run the tests in a particular file:

    ruby ./basic_tests.rb -v
    ruby ./pool_resize_tests.rb -v


You may find that udev interferes with your tests.  The typical
symptom is test scripts being unable to remove devices (because udev
has it open).

One way to disable udev is:

  mv /lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks.rules /lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks.rules.dieudevdie
