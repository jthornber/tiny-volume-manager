Test suite for device-mapper thin provisioning targets.  Uses Ruby
1.9.x.

To run:

Edit config.rb, adding suitable entries for you test machine.
Check things are ok with a dry run:

     ruby1.9 ./run_tests.rb

Once you're happy you can set the env var THIN_TESTS and run it for
real:

     export THIN_TESTS=EXECUTE
     ruby1.9 ./run_tests.rb
   
You can select subsets of the tests, for more info:

    ruby1.9 ./run_tests.rb --help

Alternatively you can run the tests in a particular file:
